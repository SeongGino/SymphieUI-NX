# SymphieUI - NX Version

Ver. (12/08/2019)
---
To install, extract the SymphieUI_NX-TypeX folders to ~/home/.esoteric/skins/.

This pack is targeted for 350teric ver. 12/04/2019 or newer.

The three versions provided are all made exclusively for 350teric's (default) grid mode, when using more than one column of links. The background design is not made for list mode, so please keep this in mind! Each one corresponds to the three window styles; "TypeA" is Phantasia-style boxes, and "TypeB" + "TypeC" are the default and golden-brown Symphonia-style boxes with respective bordering. Each one defaults to the "F-style" wallpaper (texture-less for Phanta-style, paper texture for Symphie-style); you can change the wallpaper freely using the included A-through-F background.pngs for each respective window style using the standard wallpaper selection dialog.

If you'd like to use the built-in loaders (for first boot), then rename the provided 'loader\loaderENG/JPN.conf' to 'loader\loader.conf'. These are rather lengthy, hence why they're nulled out by default. If more reliable loader skip functionality is implemented, then these may become default in the future.

This pack currently aims to *loosely* emulate the feel of the original menu interfaces (in all portrayed styles) used in the GameCube JRPG, Tales of Symphonia.

If you've played any of the Final Fantasy games past IV/US II, then you already have an idea of the customization used in this game - but Symphonia takes it to another level by providing three distinct window styles (aptly named "Windows") with different default colors and borders, and seven(!) choices of window texture - all with completely customizeable RGB & Alpha values. Of course, these being static .pngs we're working with, this runtime-level customizability isn't possible; but at least all seven background styles are included using each window style's default coloring to make up for this.

The skin is about 75% complete based on its original concept, but currently uses placeholder button graphics from the tangentially-related LegieUI (based on Legendia), and is also missing custom icons. I intended to make thematically appropriate icons made for at least the basic system items, but thanks to laziness/not being a graphic design major, these have been pushed to the backlog for now. While I plan to do this for the system category, there are no guarantees for apps/emus/games as there's WAY too friggin many to account for.

## Credits

**m1024x:** Inspiration for small widget designs, use of `retrogame-skin-pack/PSNext` icons as placeholders until better/more original ones come through.

**Massimiliano Torromeo & podulator:** For making the original GMenu2x and 350teric, respectively, and for providing sources for detailed skin customization.

**Namco Tales Team:** Inspiration for design, liberous assets usage, and for making an *okay* RPG that has WAY too many bad re-releases to count. What the heck?

**Depression and Procrastination:** Because of course.
